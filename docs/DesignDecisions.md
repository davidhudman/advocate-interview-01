## Design Decisions

Several key design decisions were made in this project to balance functionality, maintainability, and development speed:

### TypeScript Implementation

**Decision**: Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

**Rationale**:

- Strong typing helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- Improves code maintenance through better IDE support and self-documentation
- Facilitates team collaboration with clearer interfaces and type contracts
- Enables more reliable refactoring

### SQLite with Knex.js

**Decision**: Use SQLite as the database with Knex.js as the query builder.

**Rationale**:

- SQLite provides a zero-configuration database perfect for demos and small applications
- Files can be easily backed up, versioned, and shared
- Knex.js offers a clean query interface without the complexity of a full ORM
- Migration system ensures consistent schema across all environments

### Bidirectional Integration Pattern

**Decision**: Implement a semi-automated bidirectional integration.

**Rationale**:

- Manual triggers for outbound synchronization give control over when updates occur
- Automatic webhook processing for inbound changes ensures timely updates
- This asymmetric approach balances control (outbound) with responsiveness (inbound)
- Sync status tracking provides visibility into integration state

### Environment Separation

**Decision**: Maintain separate test and production environments.

**Rationale**:

- Isolated databases prevent test data from contaminating production
- Environment-specific configuration simplifies testing
- Consistent environment switching mechanism makes testing more reliable
- Minimal setup required to switch between environments

### In-Memory Mock CRM

**Decision**: Implement the CRM API as an in-memory mock within the same application.

**Rationale**:

- Demonstrates integration patterns without external dependencies
- Simplifies setup for new developers and test environments
- Provides predictable behavior for testing
- Can be replaced with a real CRM API without changing the integration logic

### Frontend Dashboard

**Decision**: Include a simple frontend for visualizing the system state.

**Rationale**:

- Makes the demonstration more accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Provides an easy way to verify system health and test results
- Creates a more complete application showcase
- Demonstrates full-stack capabilities without significant added complexity

### Structured Error Handling

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling with retry logic.

**Rationale**:

- Exponential backoff retries improve resilience against transient failures
- Structured logging provides visibility into system behavior
- Consistent error response format improves API usability
- Clear separation between client errors and server errors

These design decisions were made to create a robust, maintainable application that demonstrates real-world integration patterns while remaining simple enough to understand quickly.
