## ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Implement Error Handling, Retry Logic, and Logging

ðŸ“Œ **Objective:** Improve the systemâ€™s resilience by implementing retry logic for failed requests and adding structured logging.

ðŸ”¹ **Prompt:**

Enhance the Express.js backend to include:

### Retry Logic for Failed Sync Requests:

- If a sync request to the CRM API (POST /crm/users) fails (e.g., network error, 500 Internal Server Error), retry the request up to 3 times.
- Implement exponential backoff (e.g., first retry after 1 second, second retry after 2 seconds, third retry after 4 seconds).
- If all retries fail, log the failure and update the userâ€™s sync_status = "failed".

### Retry Logic for Webhook Updates:

- If a webhook update (POST /webhook) fails due to a temporary issue (e.g., database lock), retry processing it up to 3 times before logging the failure.

### Structured Logging:

- Use Winston or Pino to log important events such as:
  - Successful and failed sync attempts.
  - Webhook updates.
  - OAuth2 token retrieval failures.
  - Errors during retries.
- Logs should include timestamps, request details, and error messages for debugging.

### Return Proper Error Responses:

- Ensure meaningful error messages are returned for failed requests (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).

âœ… **Automated Test Prompt:**

Write Jest (and Supertest if you want but not required) tests to verify:

- If a CRM API request fails, the system retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
- If a webhook update fails, it retries up to 3 times before logging an error.
- If all retries fail, the userâ€™s sync_status updates to "failed".
- Log entries are created for:
  - Successful syncs
  - Failed syncs
  - Webhook processing attempts
  - OAuth2 token retrieval failures
