# Date Format Consistency Issue Resolution

## Problem

When examining database records, I noticed inconsistent date formats in the last_updated field:

- Some records had ISO 8601 format with T and Z: `2025-03-06T04:59:39.809Z`
- Others had a more human-readable format: `2025-03-06 04:45:16`

## Investigation

- The database schema sets the default value using `knex.fn.now()`, which produces the human-readable format
- Manual timestamp updates in code (using `new Date().toISOString()` or webhook payloads) were creating the ISO format with T and Z
- Considered changing the database default, but realized the simpler solution was to stop overriding timestamps in application code

## Solution

- Keep the database migration as is with `defaultTo(knex.fn.now())`
- Remove manual timestamp assignments in application code (in webhook and sync controllers)
- Let the database handle timestamp generation consistently

```typescript
// Original migration - keep this as is
table.timestamp("last_updated").defaultTo(knex.fn.now());
// Remove code like this in controllers
await db("users")
  .where({ crm_id })
  .update({
    ...updated_fields,
    last_updated: timestamp, // Remove this line
  });
```

## Outcome

- All timestamps now use the consistent human-readable format
- Removed unnecessary code that was causing the inconsistency
- Simplified the application logic by delegating timestamp generation to the database
